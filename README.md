A digital card

This is an open-source project. However, if you use this code, you NEED to give credit to me. When providing credit, refer to this github project. Not showing credit will result in a report for not following guide lines of fair use <3.

Taking bits of the code is allowed as long as the final product is different from what the final product is of this project. If both products are similar, a report will be issued <3.

This was written from scratch by me. It took me 4 hours to write and 1 hour to debug. If you see that things can be more efficient in the code, you can edit it. Leave comments on the places you made edits as this will make it easy for debugging for others if something were to go wrong
